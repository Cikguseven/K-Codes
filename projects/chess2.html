                <h3>Purpose of move generation</h3>

                <p>Move generation is performed in chess bots and engines to determine what moves are available. These moves are then evaluated by the bot or engine to determine the best move to make. In order for chess bots and engines to make a move quickly, move generation must be done quickly as evaluation requires certain amount of time as well. As such, I was trying out various methods to perform move generation is chess to a certain depth. This meant trying out various algorithms to perform move generation accurately. I also compared the optimised versions of the algorithms based on the time required to generate moves from various positions.</p>

                <h3>Defining the task</h3>

                <p>Depth in move generation refers to how many moves ahead by both players we are looking at. In the starting position, move generation at a depth of 1 means we consider all possible moves that White can make, which is 20. A depth of 2 means we consider all of White's moves, and all possible responses by Black. We then return the sum of possible responses by Black to each of White's possible moves, which is 400. This continues until we reach the desired depth.</p>

                <h3>Naive approach</h3>

                <p>For the first version of the algorithm, I used a simple approach that combined the logic and OOP structure of the <a href="chess" target="_blank">chess game written for Pygame</a>. Each piece was represented by a class and the chess board state was stored in an array.The game already had a move generation logic, albeit at a depth of one for the current player. There was work to be done to update the logic to generate moves recursively until a certain depth. As mentioned before, I could reference <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Perft_Results">Perft results on Chess Programming Wiki</a> to test my move generation on various tricky positions.</p>

                <div class="imgdiv">

                    <p class="imgdescription">One of the tricky positions from the wiki</p>
                </div>

                <p>In this position, white is unable to advance the pawn on b5 as it would lead to a discovered check due to the black rook on h5. In addition, there would be double checks at higher depth, which limits the number of valid moves as the king needs to avoid being attacked by multiple pieces in the following move. Handling all these positions took a bit of debugging in order to correct my algorithm. It was extremely helpful to check the results of my algorithm against Stockfish. It can return the correct result in less than a millisecond, which was demoralising as I was really far off compared to its performance.</p>

                <h3>Performance</h3>

                <p>As the first version was more of getting it correct than being able to run quickly, it was no surprise that the time taken for move generation was REALLY slow. I benchmarked my algorithm on my PC with Ryzen 5 3600 CPU and 16 GBs of RAM. Generating moves to a depth of 3 from the initial position took about 4.5 seconds, which was downright unacceptable. I used Pycharm's profiler to look at the main operations of the algorithm, and realised that deepcopying the board array took a significant amount of time. As such, the next version of the algorithm will try to reduce deepcopy operations.</p>

                <h3>Version 2</h3>

                <p>For the next version, I used a string to represent the board's FEN instead of an array, as a string is immutable and can be assigned to another variable by duplication. This change alone significantly reduced the amount of deepcopy operations and sped up the algorithm by a factor of 10. I also implemented more helper functions to check if a piece can capture another and if the king is in check.</p>

                <h3>Version 3</h3>
                <p>For the next version, I decided to precompute the moves for knight and king pieces for each of the 64 squares. Having a lookup table for these moves meant much fewer calculations were performed during move generation, at the expense of using more space. Instead of using a single string to represent the board, I now used separate strings to store white and black piece positions, as well as king positions. Doing so allowed me to perform operations directly on the strings, instead of having to decode the FEN string repeatedly at every step. These changes brought another tenfold improvement in algorithm runtime for move generation. </p>

                <h3>Benchmarking</h3>
                <p>As mentioned earlier, I recorded the time it took for the move generation algorithm to enumerate the number of possible moves at a certain depth. For the position above (FEN: r3k2r/p6p/8/B7/1pp1p3/3b4/P6P/R3K2R w KQkq -), there were 17 initial moves that white can make, with a total of 150,072 total moves at a depth of 4. The results for the various algorithms are shown below. Nodes per second refer to the number of positions that the algorithm can consider in a second, and is used as a main measure of speed for chess engines. For comparison, Stockfish can evaluate around 100 million nodes per second on a high-end consumer CPU.</p>

                        <td>241</td>
                      </tr>
                  </table> 



                <h3>Future work</h3>
                <p>After completing the third version of the algorithm, I came across <a href="https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5313417/Worlds-Fastest-Bitboard-Chess-Movegenerator">this project</a> and was inspired by their method of using bitboards. To further improve the move generation programme, I would rewrite the logic using bitboards to represent the board and perform more efficient calculations. In addition, the project also used C++, which should run faster than Python.</p>
                
                <p>Looking back at this project in 2024, I can now hardly understand the code I written. I had a lot of fun working on the move generation algorithm. I was still learning coding at that time, and it was a pretty neat accomplishment to complete this without referring to the works of others. Although the structure of the code and variable naming was a mess, I now know the practices I should have followed to make it easier to read and maintain.</p>
