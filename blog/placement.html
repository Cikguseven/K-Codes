                <h3>About the test</h3>

                <p>In short, the placement test is for those who have previously took the A levels and have prior programming experience. It was a 2 hour, online closed book test on 7 July in 2022 with an application fee of $50. Passing the test allows you to be exempted from taking the CS1010 module (Programming Methodology 1) or equivalent (CS1101S for Computer Science majors) when you matriculate in NUS. The other way to be exempted is to complete CS1010X, which allows students who have completed National Service to attend classes from January to June before taking an examination. Here are the topics that is covered in CS1010X based on a NUSMods review.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Functional Abstraction</li>
                    <li>Variable Scope, Wishful Thinking</li>
                    <li>Recursion, Iteration</li>
                    <li>Order Of Growth</li>
                    <li>Higher Order Functions</li>
                    <li>Data Abstraction</li>
                    <li>Sequences</li>
                    <li>Basic Searching and Sorting</li>
                    <li>Data Structures</li>
                    <li>Data Directed Programming</li>
                    <li>Object Oriented Programming</li>
                    <li>Dynamic Programming, Memoization</li>
                    <li>Basic Java Syntax</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Since most of the content could be self-taught from the Internet, I chose to save $800 and 6 months of my time by taking the $50 placement test instead. Thankfully, the placement test did not test all of the above topics, but mainly focused on the algorithm design and dynamic programming aspects of the above content.</p>

                <h3>My experience taking the test</h3>

                <p>I found out about the test from a senior a few months before matriculating. He told me not to waste time taking CS1101S if I knew how to code. I then registered as a Computer Science student and I was allowed to choose the language to take the test in. I chose Python instead of C and Java as I was much more proficient in it. The test was held on LumiNUS and we were required to record ourselves and our monitor using Panopto. This was the beginning of using Panopto for examination proctoring in NUS.</p>

                <p>There is also a <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/programmes/ug/exemptions/sda-prog-meth" target="_blank">self-diagnostic assessment</a> on the website that serves as a mock-up of the actual test. According to NUS, the scope of the test was math, logic, problem solving and mastery of chosen programming language. This self-diagnostic assessment was pretty challenging and it made me realise how unfamiliar i was with syntax and nuances of Python.</p>

                <h3>Preparation</h3>
                <p>I decided to git gud and read CS1010 cheatsheets, <a href="https://www.angelfire.com/tx4/cus/pl/sicp_python_01.html" target="_blank">SICP</a> and <a href="https://github.com/satwikkansal/wtfpython" target="_blank">the quirks of the language</a>. I also learnt about the different sorting algorithms and their time & space complexities. <a href="https://visualgo.net/en" target="_blank">Visualgo</a> was a useful tool by NUS for teaching this subject. Lastly, I studied the behaviour and limitations of data structures in Python. The test mainly seemed to focus on the unique behaviour of list aliasing, using map/filter/reduce, lambda expressions as well as shallow & deep copying. I also found a telegram group through Reddit, which had others preparing for the test. The group shared past year CS1010 papers for practice and discussed the harder questions.</p>

                </div>

                <h3>Test briefing</h3>
                <p>One day before the actual test, NUS conducted a trial run to address potential technical issues. We had to set up our screen recording using Panopto and log in to LumiNUS using a provided account to do a mock test. The professor who wrote the questions for the examination clarified what the scope of the test was. Again, instead of testing all the topics in the CS1010X syllabus, the test was about math, programming syntax and algorithm design.</p>

                <h3>Actual test</h3>
                <p>Before the test started, we had to join a zoom call and turn on our web camera for proctoring. During the online test, we had to type out our answers in a textbox for the open ended questions. It was a terrible experience coding in a textbox without having the tab key for indentation. We were also unable to use an interpreter to check if our code has any errors. However, the test was relatively easier as compared to the self-diagnostic assessment.</p>

                <p>The first few multiple choice questions about Python syntax and math were quite straightforward. Next, there were a couple of questions about tracing a given function and answering what the correct output would be. There were also questions that required us to write simple functions with conditional statements based on the question requirement. Finally, 2 open ended questions tested our algorithm design as we needed to solve this <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/island-perimeter/" target="_blank">Leetcode Easy problem</a>. It was about computing the area and perimeter of an "island" in a 5 by 5 grid. I spent my last half an hour to think of a working solution and ensuring all the edge cases were covered. I did not bother optimizing my O(n<sup>2</sup>) solution as they were only looking for a valid solution and not the fastest one. I was pretty confident that I answered most of the questions correctly and could pass the test. Grinding Leetcode under time constraint is now a good idea in hindsight.</p>

                <h3>Aftermath</h3>
                <p>I was notified that I passed the placement text on 18 July 2022. Thus, I was exempted from taking CS1101S and I could take CS2030S (Programming Methodology 2) as CS1010/CS1101S is the prerequisite. Although I am able to skip this mod, it does not count towards my NUS grades as it is a pass/fail test. In addition, I do have regrets about skipping CS1101S. I would advise against taking the placement test as taking CS1010/CS1101S with prior programming knowledge would pretty much guarantee you an A in the module. At the same time, taking CS2030/S in semester 1 is not a good idea as the cohort typically consists of other students who have programming background and the bell curve tend to be against you. The decision is ultimately yours and if you're a leet coder who's built different then go ahead and skip this basic 4MC mod.</p>
