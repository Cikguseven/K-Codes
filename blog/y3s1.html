                <p>It's the third year of school and I have more or less completed the curriculum requirements. I decided to only take 4 courses this semester to focus on other commitments. Since I will be going for exchange the following semester, I had to avoid taking courses that could be mapped like CS3230. I also planned to take AI courses to fulfill a second focus area.</p>

                <h3>ALS1010</h3>
                <h4>Learning to Learn Better</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Professors: Robert Kamei, Magdeline Ng</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Difficulty: 2/10</li>
                    <li>Effort: 3/10</li>
                    <li>Usefulness: 8/10</li>
                    <li>Enjoyment: 4/10</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Grade: CS</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This module is a summarised version of the strategic learning book by Dr Kamei. It is split into 6 Zoom sessions across the semester. Each session covers a chapter or two from the book through interactive activities and live discussions. There aren't many deliverables besides a goal setting activity and subsequent follow ups. I was doing other assignments during the Zoom sessions when the semester was busy, occasionally checking the meeting if I had to answer questions. It has definitely been an enjoyable and low effort course to clear 2 MCs.</p>

                <h3>GEC1030</h3>
                <h4>Metropolis: The City in World History</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Professors: Portia Reyes</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Difficulty: 5/10</li>
                    <li>Effort: 6/10</li>
                    <li>Usefulness: 3/10</li>
                    <li>Enjoyment: 7/10</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Expected Grade: A</li>
                    <li>Actual Grade: </li>
                </ul>

                <p>One of the more chill CS 2K modules to balance your workload. Lectures were recorded and Prof Leong was pretty entertaining. Tutorials were not too challenging and can be done in an hour or less. Assignments 1 and 2 were time consuming but there were hints provided on Piazza by the teaching staff. Midterms were open book, but it was a tough MRQ paper that the past year papers didn't really prepare us for.</p>

                <h3>CS2109S</h3>
                <h4>Introduction to AI and Machine Learning</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Professors: Muhammad Rizki Aulia Rahman Maulana, Hu Conghui</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Difficulty: 6/10</li>
                    <li>Effort: 8/10</li>
                    <li>Usefulness: 7/10</li>
                    <li>Enjoyment: 6/10</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Expected Grade: A</li>
                    <li>Actual Grade: </li>
                </ul>

                <p>A relatively new AI module that is part of the foundational requirements for CS. The module still requires fine-tuning as the content is not organised well and the math behind the theory is often skipped during lectures. Assignments on Coursemology are supposed to be bi-weekly but it feels like I have to do a problem set every week. Since everyone was expected to get full credit from Coursemology, the assessment weightage was basically 50% Midterms and 50% Finals.</p>

                <p>Midterms was on Examplify, which made it harder to read and understand the questions. The questions also felt significantly more challenging than the past year papers.</p>


                <h3>CS3223</h3>
                <h4>Database Systems Implementation</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Professor: Chan Chee Yong</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Difficulty: 7/10</li>
                    <li>Effort: 8/10</li>
                    <li>Usefulness: 5/10</li>
                    <li>Enjoyment: 7/10</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Expected Grade: A</li>
                    <li>Actual Grade: </li>
                </ul>

                <p>I took this module to clear my database specialisation. It is only offered in semester 2, with most of the cohort being year 3 or 4 CS students. There were plenty of good reviews for the prof and how well run this module was. I don't think there's anything special about it, just that there are no screw ups so far compared to other CS modules. Tutorials are challenging and require a few rounds of revision to fully grasp the content.</p> 
                    
                <p>Assignment 1 was really painful as we had to modify Postgres source code to implement LRU cache, which many of us required a time extension for the deadline. Despite being a pairwork assignment, I spent the entire week 6 working on this as we had to understand the hundreds of lines of source code before going in blind when implementing our own cache. Testing our code on a VM was signifcantly faster than using the SoC server, which was congested and slow especially towards the submission deadline.</p>

                <p>Midterms were challenging and doing the past year papers did not help much as the previous professor who taught the mod set a different style of questions. There were plenty of calculation questions with intricacies that became traps.</p>

                <h3>GESS1025</h3>
                <h4>Singapore: Imagining the Next 50 Years</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Tutor: Warren Choo</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Difficulty: 4/10</li>
                    <li>Effort: 5/10</li>
                    <li>Usefulness: 5/10</li>
                    <li>Enjoyment: 5/10</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Expected Grade: CS</li>
                    <li>Actual Grade: </li>
                </ul>

                <p>The famous CS/CU GESS module that every NUS student tries to bid for. The workload is relatively reasonable, with weekly videos and a short critical reflection on an article about the week's topic. There is also a group presentation and writeup that takes up some time, but because this is a pass fail module, no one puts in 100% effort for this component. My tutor was really chill and focused more on going through the points and ideas raised by the authors in regards to Singaporean society and the future of the nation. The final exam is an open book quiz with MCQ and short response questions.</p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>I should have planned my semester better as I did not expect to get many of the modules I bid for. It's nice to be able to take 4 core modules and have breathing room to focus on other things.</p>
