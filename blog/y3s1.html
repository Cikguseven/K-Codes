                <p>It's the third year of school and I have more or less completed the curriculum requirements. I decided to only take 4 courses this semester to focus on other commitments. Since I will be going for exchange the following semester, I had to avoid taking courses that could be mapped like CS3230. I also planned to take AI courses to fulfill a second focus area.</p>

                <h3>ALS1010</h3>
                <h4>Learning to Learn Better</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Professors: Robert Kamei, Magdeline Ng</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Difficulty: 2/10</li>
                    <li>Effort: 3/10</li>
                    <li>Usefulness: 8/10</li>
                    <li>Enjoyment: 4/10</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Grade: CS</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This module is a summarised version of the strategic learning book by Dr Kamei. It is split into 6 Zoom sessions across the semester. Each session covers a chapter or two from the book through interactive activities and live discussions. There aren't many deliverables besides a goal setting activity and subsequent follow ups. I was doing other assignments during the Zoom sessions when the semester was busy, occasionally checking the meeting if I had to answer questions. It has definitely been an enjoyable and low effort course to clear 2 MCs.</p>

                <h3>GEC1030</h3>
                <h4>Metropolis: The City in World History</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Professor: Portia Reyes</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Difficulty: 5/10</li>
                    <li>Effort: 6/10</li>
                    <li>Usefulness: 3/10</li>
                    <li>Enjoyment: 7/10</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Expected Grade: A</li>
                    <li>Actual Grade: </li>
                </ul>

                <p>I wanted to take the GEC1028 but it wasn't available this semester so this was the alternative that seemed the most interesting. The module is largely a history class about cities with lots of writing assignments that were letter graded. Bi weekly tutorials were engaging even for someone who had zero background on cities and wasn't familiar with the required analytical approach for history assignments. The weekly chapters and themes were useful for tutorials and assignments, but I didn't really follow the content after recess week. As a result, I struggled to complete he final essay project even though it was interesting as we got to do a case study on a city of our choice. I was prepared to SU this course but it turned out that I got an A for my final essay.</p>

                <h3>CS2106</h3>
                <h4>Introduction to Operating Systems</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Professors: Li Jialin, Colin Tan Keng Yan</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Difficulty: 6/10</li>
                    <li>Effort: 8/10</li>
                    <li>Usefulness: 9/10</li>
                    <li>Enjoyment: 7/10</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Expected Grade: A</li>
                    <li>Actual Grade: </li>
                </ul>

                <p>One of the supposedly killer CS courses that was recommended to be taken on exchange, along with CS3230. However, it wasn't as challenging or tedious as I heard, probably because I was taking CS3210 concurrently. There were 4 lab assignments spaced out during the semester, and the weekly tutorials were engaging thanks to my really passionate and quirky tutor. The content was a little confusing during lectures, despite Prof Li being detailed, but the bigger picture became more apparent as I was revising for finals. Midterms was relatively straightforward while finals was a mix of easy and really tough questions. The posted finals grade for my friends and I didn't corroborate with the answer key so we were left confused with what our actual grade would be.</p>


                <h3>CS3210</h3>
                <h4>Parallel Computing</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Professors: Cristina Carbunaru, Sriram Sami</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Difficulty: 7/10</li>
                    <li>Effort: 9/10</li>
                    <li>Usefulness: 8/10</li>
                    <li>Enjoyment: 8/10</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Expected Grade: A</li>
                    <li>Actual Grade: </li>
                </ul>

                <p>This module was difficult at first since it assumed that students had prior Operating Systems knowledge from CS2106. The first few lectures were a recap of OS content that I had not learnt, but Prof Cristina was understanding and she gave us a crash course about memory management through a casual chat during one of the lab sessions. Sriram was also passionate and energetic as a lecturer, and was responsive when overseeing the assignments.</p>

                <p>The content is split into practical applications of parallel computing via OpenMP, CUDA and OpenMPI, as well as the theoretical calculations involving parallel systems. The first few weeks was mainly focus on getting our hands dirty and writing parallel programmes in our lab assignments. The actual project assignments could be done as pair work, but the amount of effort required to beat the performance benchmarks was quite crazy. There were plenty of things to test and optimize in order to speed up parallel programmes, and I ended up spending the entire recess week working on the first assignment. The workload got better as the semester progressed and the final theory paper was completely different from the coding implementation aspect. Finals was much more challenging than the past year papers, with a few questions requiring actual code to be filled in instead of pseudocode.</p>

                <h3>CS3264</h3>
                <h4>Foundations of Machine Learning</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Professor: Harold Soh Soon Hong</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Difficulty: 9/10</li>
                    <li>Effort: 6/10</li>
                    <li>Usefulness: 7/10</li>
                    <li>Enjoyment: 5/10</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Expected Grade: A</li>
                    <li>Actual Grade: </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Wow. I did not know what I was signing up for when I chose this course. The amount of math and advanced techniques involved in tutorials and especially exams was pretty traumatic. The course felt like it was meant for Math majors instead of CS as the approaches and workings were not within my grasp and only made sense after the tutor or prof explained them. My tutor did a terrible job in explaining the tutorial questions as he rushed through the questions and mumbled to himself instead of projecting to the class. I ended up going to another tutorial and the tutor did a much better job at clarifying our misconceptions. Midterms was tough and a wake up call for most students to try harder for finals. The practice papers felt much easier than the actual exam and there was simply no way to prepare for the questions that came out. It was one of those CS courses that was an IQ test, and I was definitely not expecting that. I lost interest in the course towards finals as the exam was really late (Wednesday of the second week of exams) and tried my best to push myself over the finish line. Somehow, my preparation for finals paid off even though it was a challenging paper as well and I think I did fine after discussing with my peers.</p>
