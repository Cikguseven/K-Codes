                <p> The first semester in NUS was a really hectic one, especially after recess week. The workload was much greater than JC and final exams felt like A levels condensed into four months. Classes were mainly back to physical lectures and tutorials with the exception of large group lectures. Looking back, I felt like I focused too much on the small details like online quizzes and I should learn to take things as they come.</p>

                <h3>CFG1002</h3>
                <h4>Career Catalyst</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Instructor: Ryan Ang Kwok Peow</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Difficulty: 2/10</li>
                    <li>Effort: 2/10</li>
                    <li>Usefulness: 7/10</li>
                    <li>Enjoyment: 5/10</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Grade: CS</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This CS/CU module covers the basics on career planning and preparing for a job. There were six weeks of web presentations that gave interview and personal branding tips. We were also required to complete a mock resume and elevator pitch for assessment. They used an AI to evaluate our resumes that resulted in a boilerplate and unoriginal draft. The module also introduced us to the different avenues NUS has for networking and finding internship opportunities. Overall, it's a low effort CS/CU module and most of the content covered can be found on the NUS CFG website.</p>

                <h3>CS1231S</h3>
                <h4>Discrete Structures</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Professors: Aaron Tan Tuck Choy & Leong Hon Wai</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Difficulty: 7/10</li>
                    <li>Effort: 8/10</li>
                    <li>Usefulness: 7/10</li>
                    <li>Enjoyment: 9/10</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Expected Grade: A</li>
                    <li>Actual Grade: A+</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Infamous module about discrete math and logic for CS students that turned out to be very interesting. Prof Aaron managed to make the lectures entertaining despite the content being dry. He was also concerned with our well-being and motivated us along the way. The tutorial questions were much more challenging that those tested during exams. I was worried about doing badly because I had to google every other question when doing weekly tutorials. Exams were open book and it really helped when we didn't need to memorise definitions and formulae and focused on the problem solving aspects. However, there was still a need to study and practise past year papers to cover the gaps in lecture content.</p>

                <h3>CS2030S</h3>
                <h4>Programming Methodology II</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Professor: Adi Yoga Sidi Prabawa</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Difficulty: 9/10</li>
                    <li>Effort: 10/10</li>
                    <li>Usefulness: 8/10</li>
                    <li>Enjoyment: 3/10</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Expected Grade: A-</li>
                    <li>Actual Grade: B</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This module was a big mess. The lecture slides were brief and I had to reread the online notes to understand content. The labs were tough and I only survived because of my friends taking the module. The lab requirements were unclear at times and there were often typos or errors as well. I had no clue what was going on during the functional programming labs as they expected us to know content that had not yet been taught. Practical exams were just a scramble to code out something that compiles. Spending 2 hours panic coding on an auditorium seat does wonders for the mental health and posture. The module also required us to use Vim, an archaic text editor, for the practical exams. My quality of life increased significantly after discovering IntelliJ. Was hoping for a better overall grade since there was no bell-curve apparently but the range of A and A- was still pretty high.</p>

                <h3>DMX1501AI</h3>
                <h4>AI4I â€“ Foundations in AI</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Difficulty: 5/10</li>
                    <li>Effort: 2/10</li>
                    <li>Usefulness: 7/10</li>
                    <li>Enjoyment: 6/10</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Grade: CS</li>
                </ul>

                <p>A DYOC CS/CU module by AISG that can be completed in a day for 5 MCs! This module is used to farm MCs in the nick of time, but it is also useful in teaching basic AI and ML concepts. There are about 10 topics and a review quiz with unlimited tries to pass at the end of each topic. Just like the standard DYOC modules, NUS reimburses the registration fee once you have completed it.</p>

                <h3>GEA1000</h3>
                <h4>Quantitative Reasoning with Data</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Tutor: Dr Amanda Soon</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Difficulty: 4/10</li>
                    <li>Effort: 6/10</li>
                    <li>Usefulness: 7/10</li>
                    <li>Enjoyment: 6/10</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Expected Grade: A+</li>
                    <li>Actual Grade: A+</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This module covers basic statistics and usage of Excel & Radiant for data visualisation. The content has some overlap with statistics in H2 math. The workload was very manageable other than the group project that consisted of making slides, writing a report and a presentation to prepare for. The only downside of this module is the 3 hour tutorial that becomes a real snoozefest when the lunch food coma hits. Bell-curve for this module is pretty steep as the exams are MCQ and everyone scores well. Other than the group project, the knowledge of using Excel/Radiant was not tested.</p>

                <h3>HSI1000</h3>
                <h4>How Science Works, Why Science Works</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Tutors: Sankar & Hao Kai</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Difficulty: 6/10</li>
                    <li>Effort: 5/10</li>
                    <li>Usefulness: 3/10</li>
                    <li>Enjoyment: 5/10</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Expected Grade: A</li>
                    <li>Actual Grade: A-</li>
                </ul>

                <p>I took this module to clear Interdisciplinary (ID) requirements and it sounded kinda interesting from the name. Although the first part of the module did cover the scientific method and fact-checking skills, the second half was just about proving climate change deniers wrong. The lectures were on Microsoft Sway and had a storytelling format. Exams were open book and we could CTRL-F to find the answers in lecture transcripts. There was also a self learning journey to a nature reserve & park to carry out fieldwork. The workshops were another 3 hour snoozefest but the labs were intriguing as they demonstrated different scientific ideas and principles without requiring us to have an in-depth understanding of the science behind it.</p>

                <h3>MA1521</h3>
                <h4>Calculus for Computing</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Professor: Leung Ka Hin</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Difficulty: 8/10</li>
                    <li>Effort: 6/10</li>
                    <li>Usefulness: 5/10</li>
                    <li>Enjoyment: 6/10</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Expected Grade: A</li>
                    <li>Actual Grade: A</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The module started off easy with a recap of H2 calculus and vectors. After recess week, it got me good when they pulled out the sequences, multivariable calculus and double integrals. The exams only allowed for a 1 page cheat sheet and I spent way too long trying to cramp all the formulae in instead of studying. Some of the questions in the finals were completely new (so much for grinding past year papers) and really tested our application skills. Would have secured an A+ if I didn't choke the 60% finals.</p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>And that's a wrap for Year 1 Sem 1. I kinda regret not trying harder for CS2030S since I cannot S/U it. Oh wells, guess its time to prep and get ready for Sem 2. Tune in next time to see how overloading with 6 mods works out!</p>
