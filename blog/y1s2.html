                <p> The second semester in NUS was pretty packed, with six modules that included CS2040S. I chose to overload as I wanted to use some S/Us in Sem 2. The gamified pedagogy of CS2040S meant that there were many online assignments in the form of Problem Sets and bonus practices to be completed for the necessary requirements to score an A. This semester had 2 mods involving a written group report, which helped to balance the workload of the other mods. It was also very enjoyable to take French lessons as I was heading to Europe in summer. </p>

                <h3>CS2040S</h3>
                <h4>Data Structures and Algorithms</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Professor: Seth Gilbert & Arnab Bhattacharya</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Difficulty: 7/10</li>
                    <li>Effort: 8/10</li>
                    <li>Usefulness: 10/10</li>
                    <li>Enjoyment: 10/10</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Expected Grade: A</li>
                    <li>Actual Grade: A</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Arguably the most important module in CS and one of the holy trinity mods, CS2040S has been extremely useful in teaching the various algorithms and data structures used to solve problems. Weekly problem sets were challenging but not too difficult, along with tutorials and recitations that take a fair amount of time to fully complete. Exams were MCQ, but a good test of subject comprehension without needing to memorise content. This mod has been enjoyable and fun with Professor Seth teaching the bulk of lectures. Can finally grind Leetcode now!</p>

                <h3>IS1108</h3>
                <h4>Digital Ethics and Data Privacy</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Lecturer: Lee Boon Kee</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Difficulty: 5/10</li>
                    <li>Effort: 7/10</li>
                    <li>Usefulness: 6/10</li>
                    <li>Enjoyment: 5/10</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Expected Grade: A</li>
                    <li>Actual Grade: A</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Truly a fluff mod about ethics where we come up with multi-faceted approaches in dealing with moral dilemmas in the context of computing. Lectures are optional and quizzes can be completed with discussion. Tutorials were pretty dry with most sessions having us use a template to brainstorm solutions to ethical issues. 3000 word final group report was very manageable with the right group mates.</p>


                <h3>IS1128</h3>
                <h4>IT, Management and Organisation</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Professor: Yang Lu</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Difficulty: 4/10</li>
                    <li>Effort: 5/10</li>
                    <li>Usefulness: 5/10</li>
                    <li>Enjoyment: 7/10</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Expected Grade: A</li>
                    <li>Actual Grade: A-</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Basically a business and organisation module in the context of IT industry that isn't very relevant to most students right now. Lectures are optional and review quizzes can be done with discussion/Telegram polls. Take this mod with your friends as there is a group report where we had to work with a local company and find out how they used tech during the COVID pandemic.</p>


                <h3>LAF1201</h3>
                <h4>French 1</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Tutor: Sophie Herlin</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Difficulty: 6/10</li>
                    <li>Effort: 9/10</li>
                    <li>Usefulness: 10/10</li>
                    <li>Enjoyment: 8/10</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Expected Grade: A</li>
                    <li>Actual Grade: A</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Took this mod as an Unrestricted Elective for fun as I was going to France in summer for vacation. Lessons turned out to be fun and light hearted as we got to learn the basics of French and converse with other students in the class. Culture exposure assignments were quite interesting as well, where we could document our dining experiences at a French eatery. Tests and exams were quite memory intensive and took consistent effort every week to pick up the language.</p>


                <h3>MA2001</h3>
                <h4>Linear Algebra 1</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Professors: Wang Fei & Goh Jun Le</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Difficulty: 8/10</li>
                    <li>Effort: 7/10</li>
                    <li>Usefulness: 6/10</li>
                    <li>Enjoyment: 5/10</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Expected Grade: A</li>
                    <li>Actual Grade: A</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Challenging module even with some prior knowledge about Linear Algebra. Content is quite heavy and questions in exams are very tedious when Graphing Calculators are not allowed. Midterms was a mad rush to finish in 1 hour but finals was much more manageable. "Proving" questions are challenging and are basically bonus marks as you can't really prepare for them.</p>

                <h3>ST2334</h3>
                <h4>Probability and Statistics</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Professor: David Chew</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Difficulty: 5/10</li>
                    <li>Effort: 3/10</li>
                    <li>Usefulness: 7/10</li>
                    <li>Enjoyment: 5/10</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Expected Grade: A-</li>
                    <li>Actual Grade: A-</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The module is a recap of H2 Math statistics and covers new content as well. Lecturers were relatively slow paced and most of the mod is just about applying the right formula to do the question. Midterm and finals were doable but tricky and bellcurve was very steep.</p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>And that's another semester completed! The first year passed pretty quickly, especially with Hall activities. Looking forward to travelling and doing Orbital in summer!</p>
