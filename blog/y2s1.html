                <p> Now that I am in my third semester in NUS, I was focusing on clearing the Level 2000 CS mods in order to clear my core requirements and take Focus Area specialisation mods in future semesters. I chose to take only 5 mods as I had already cleared 59 MCs after Year 1 summer. Essentially, I had 4 CS mods to juggle in this semester. In hindsight, I think it's better not to take so many CS mods as the workload is significantly greater than 10 hours a week for 4 MCs.</p>

                <h3>CFG1003</h3>
                <h4>Financial Wellbeing-Introduction</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Difficulty: 2/10</li>
                    <li>Effort: 2/10</li>
                    <li>Usefulness: 6/10</li>
                    <li>Enjoyment: 5/10</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Grade: CS</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This module provides an introduction to financial well being by focusing on money narratives, budgeting and principles around financial decision making. It's a 0 MC module that is a pre-requisite for CFG1004, and the e-learning assessment can be completed over a weekend. I didn't learn much from this but I think its great that the school teaches practical knowledge through such modules.</p>

                <h3>CS2100</h3>
                <h4>Computer Organisation</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Professor: Aaron Tan, Colin Tan, Wong Weng Fai</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Difficulty: 6/10</li>
                    <li>Effort: 7/10</li>
                    <li>Usefulness: 8/10</li>
                    <li>Enjoyment: 8/10</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Expected Grade: A</li>
                    <li>Actual Grade: A+</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The last holy trinity mod that I am taking, CS2100 started off as an extremely content heavy mod with 3 or more hours of recorded lectures a week teaching C and the foundations for assembly language MIPS. It was more efficient to study from the lecture slides. Recitations were merely a recap of lecture content and going through weekly quizzes. Labs before recess week were mostly about using QTSpim to analyse assembly processes, and some of the sessions had to be done ahead of the lab due to the time it took. After recess week, we constructed digital circuits using Integrated Chips which were pretty fun and easy.</p>

                <p>Midterms was on Examplify and a double-sided cheatsheet was allowed. It was a mad rush to finish all the questions in 1.5 hours as compared to practice papers as there were many MIPS instruction decoding questions. As a result, there was significant result moderation to ensure that the cohort could pass.</p>

                <p>Finals was also a rush to finish all the questions on time. Though the format of the questions are more or less the same as past year papers, the questions felt more tedious and challenging. No idea how I managed to get the top students award for this mod as I felt that I did not do that well for finals.</p>

                <h3>CS2101</h3>
                <h4>Effective Communication for Computing Professionals</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Tutor: Lee Jun Hiang</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Difficulty: 4/10</li>
                    <li>Effort: 7/10</li>
                    <li>Usefulness: 6/10</li>
                    <li>Enjoyment: 5/10</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Expected Grade: A-</li>
                    <li>Actual Grade: B+</li>
                </ul>

                <p>A fluff communications mod that must be taken together with CS2103T. Most of the lessons were pretty boring and I was distracted with doing other work. We went straight into group oral presentations as the semester started, with two provisional sessions before OP1 that helped us to get our act together. We were forced to structure our presentations based on the SCQA framework even when it wasn't relevant. After recess week, the lessons were focused on product pitching and it didn't make sense to have a 10 minute provisional when the actual product pitch was 18 minutes long. The reflection assignment was quite fun as we could be creative and I did a podcast to showcase my progress. My OP grades were average and I think the grading was not transparent and based on how much we improved throughout the semester.</p>


                <h3>CS2102</h3>
                <h4>Database Systems</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Professors: Christian Von Der Weth, Stephane Bressan, Shamkant B. Navathe</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Difficulty: 7/10</li>
                    <li>Effort: 7/10</li>
                    <li>Usefulness: 7/10</li>
                    <li>Enjoyment: 6/10</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Expected Grade: A</li>
                    <li>Actual Grade: A+</li>
                </ul>

                <p>A useful and practical module to learn about databases and SQL. However, the module was poorly ran as the lecturers did not have a consistent format for lectures and tutorials. Compared to past semesters, the module had to be restructured to include Prof Navathe's textbook and we learnt slightly different content instead. Midterms and finals were quite a shitshow as the questions were badly phrased. The group assignments were also time consuming and complex. I was around the median for midterms but managed to clutch up for finals.</p>


                <h3>CS2103T</h3>
                <h4>Software Engineering</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Professors: Damith Chatura Rajapakse, Prabhu Natarajan</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Difficulty: 6/10</li>
                    <li>Effort: 10/10</li>
                    <li>Usefulness: 7/10</li>
                    <li>Enjoyment: 3/10</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Expected Grade: A</li>
                    <li>Actual Grade: A</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This module made me reconsider taking other software engineering modules in the future. There is a ton of work to do every week, from reading the content, to doing the weekly quizzes and tasks for the individual and team projects. The team project (TP) component had crazy short deadlines for each sprint, and my group had to rush all our features in order to have time to bug fix and resolve any merge issues. Even after the team project was done, we still had to prepare for the practical assessment and find fault with the other group's product. The tutorials weren't very useful and my tutor mentioned that Prof Damith micromanages the content that he has to deliver during class. I was struggling to survive during the 4 weeks of TP and I am just glad it is all over.</p>


                <h3>ES2660</h3>
                <h4>Communicating in the Information Age</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Tutor: Petrina Tee</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Difficulty: 4/10</li>
                    <li>Effort: 4/10</li>
                    <li>Usefulness: 5/10</li>
                    <li>Enjoyment: 5/10</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Expected Grade: A</li>
                    <li>Actual Grade: A-</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This communications module focuses on tech and critical thinking. The assessments are pretty fluff and I did not put in much effort for my group presentation. Wildcard was fun as we got the opportunity to cook and spontaneously discuss a random topic. I also got the chance to write an article on Human autonomy and Chess, and we could publish it on Medium after submitting it. My tutor could engage us effectively during class sessions and I was motivated to start journaling because of her, which is my biggest takeaway from this module.</p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>I'm so glad that the semester has ended as I really spent all my time doing work and not being able to rest much. My non CS modules could have fared better, but I'm just glad the CS modules were all As and above. Looking forward to taking a break in winter and being in Korea for Winter School!</p>
