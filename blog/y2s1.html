                <p> Now that I am in my third semester in NUS, I was focusing on clearing the Level 2000 CS mods in order to clear my core requirements and take Focus Area specialisation mods in future semesters. I chose to take only 5 mods as I had cleared 59 MCs after Year 1 summer and I basically had 4 CS mods to juggle in this semester. In hindsight, I think it's better not to take so many CS mods as the workload is significantly greater than 10 hours a week for 4 MCs.</p>

                <h3>CS2100</h3>
                <h4>Computer Organisation</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Professor: Aaron Tan, Colin Tan, Wong Weng Fai</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Difficulty: 6/10</li>
                    <li>Effort: 7/10</li>
                    <li>Usefulness: 8/10</li>
                    <li>Enjoyment: 8/10</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Expected Grade: A</li>
                    <li>Actual Grade:</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The last holy trinity mod that I am taking, CS2100 started off as an extremely content heavy mod with 3 or more hours of recorded lectures a week teaching C and the foundations for assembly language MIPS. It was more efficient to study from the lecture slides. Recitations were merely a recap of lecture content and going through weekly quizzes. Labs before recess week were mostly about using QTSpim to analyse assembly processes, and some of the sessions had to be done ahead of the lab due to the time it took. After recess week, we constructed digital circuits using Integrated Chips which were pretty fun and easy. </p>

                <p>Midterms was on Examplify and a double-sided cheatsheet was allowed. It was a mad rush to finish all the questions in 1.5 hours as compared to practice papers as there were many MIPS instruction decoding questions. As a result, there was significant result moderation to ensure that the cohort could pass.</p>

                <h3>CS2101</h3>
                <h4>Digital Ethics and Data Privacy</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Lecturer: Lee Boon Kee</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Difficulty: 5/10</li>
                    <li>Effort: 7/10</li>
                    <li>Usefulness: 6/10</li>
                    <li>Enjoyment: 5/10</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Expected Grade: A</li>
                    <li>Actual Grade: A</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Truly a fluff mod about ethics where we come up with multi-faceted approaches in dealing with moral dilemmas in the context of computing. Lectures are optional and quizzes can be completed with discussion. Tutorials were pretty dry with most sessions having us use a template to brainstorm solutions to ethical issues. 3000 word final group report was very manageable with the right group mates.</p>


                <h3>IS1128</h3>
                <h4>IT, Management and Organisation</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Professor: Yang Lu</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Difficulty: 4/10</li>
                    <li>Effort: 5/10</li>
                    <li>Usefulness: 5/10</li>
                    <li>Enjoyment: 7/10</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Expected Grade: A</li>
                    <li>Actual Grade: A-</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Basically a business and organisation module in the context of IT industry that isn't very relevant to most students right now. Lectures are optional and review quizzes can be done with discussion/Telegram polls. Take this mod with your friends as there is a group report where we had to work with a local company and find out how they used tech during the COVID pandemic.</p>


                <h3>LAF1201</h3>
                <h4>French 1</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Tutor: Sophie Herlin</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Difficulty: 6/10</li>
                    <li>Effort: 9/10</li>
                    <li>Usefulness: 10/10</li>
                    <li>Enjoyment: 8/10</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Expected Grade: A</li>
                    <li>Actual Grade: A</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Took this mod as an Unrestricted Elective for fun as I was going to France in summer for vacation. Lessons turned out to be fun and light hearted as we got to learn the basics of French and converse with other students in the class. Culture exposure assignments were quite interesting as well, where we could document our dining experiences at a French eatery. Tests and exams were quite memory intensive and took consistent effort every week to pick up the language.</p>


                <h3>MA2001</h3>
                <h4>Linear Algebra 1</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Professors: Wang Fei & Goh Jun Le</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Difficulty: 8/10</li>
                    <li>Effort: 7/10</li>
                    <li>Usefulness: 6/10</li>
                    <li>Enjoyment: 5/10</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Expected Grade: A</li>
                    <li>Actual Grade: A</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Challenging module even with some prior knowledge about Linear Algebra. Content is quite heavy and questions in exams are very tedious when Graphing Calculators are not allowed. Midterms was a mad rush to finish in 1 hour but finals was much more manageable. "Proving" questions are challenging and are basically bonus marks as you can't really prepare for them.</p>

                <h3>ST2334</h3>
                <h4>Probability and Statistics</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Professor: David Chew</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Difficulty: 5/10</li>
                    <li>Effort: 3/10</li>
                    <li>Usefulness: 7/10</li>
                    <li>Enjoyment: 5/10</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Expected Grade: A-</li>
                    <li>Actual Grade: A-</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The module is a recap of H2 Math statistics and covers new content as well. Lecturers were relatively slow paced and most of the mod is just about applying the right formula to do the question. Midterm and finals were doable but tricky and bellcurve was very steep.</p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>And that's another semester completed! The first year passed pretty quickly, especially with Hall activities. Looking forward to travelling and doing Orbital in summer!</p>
